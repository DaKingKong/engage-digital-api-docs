# Getting Started with Engage Routing

Routing is a critical high-level concept with the Engage Platform, as it handles how teams can share the work load across their agents and ecosystem. There are two primary ways in which workflows and workloads are managed: through a task-based system, and via folders.

All folders in Engage are "smart folders" whose contents are determined by rules defined by an administrator. This helps drive transparency across teams, and facilitates greater collaboration.

Tasks provide a more directed way of designating a specific agent to be responsible for handling and resolving a customer interaction or intervention.
