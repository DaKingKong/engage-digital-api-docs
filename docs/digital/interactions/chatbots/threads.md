# Closing Threads

One option for handling a customer inquiry is to bring it to close. A developer does this by closing the associated thread, which will block the agent from replying again on the thread in question. One instance in which it makes sense to close the thread is when the user disconnects in the middle of the conversation, thus negating the agent's need to respond. To close a thread, following these steps. 

To close a thread, a developer will perform an HTTP PUT against the close resource.
